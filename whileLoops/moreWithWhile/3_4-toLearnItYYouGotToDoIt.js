/*
	To learn it, you gotta 'do' it
	Your turn! Now that you've seen how do/while loops work, you can easily write your own. (Check the Hint if you need a syntax refresher!)

	Your loop should print a string of your choice to the editor one time. Remember: make sure you give your while condition a way to become false, or it'll loop forever!

	INSTRUCTIONS
	Write your do/while loop inside the function we've created for you, getToDaChoppa. do it now!
