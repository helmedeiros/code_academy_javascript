/*
	What you'll be building
	Now that you know how to use while loops, we'll combine them with some other control flow statements (like if/else) to create a dragon slaying minigame.

	INSTRUCTIONS
	Check out the code in the editor. Do you understand how it works? (No worries if notâ€”we'll go through it step-by-step!)
	Run it a few times to see how you fare against the dragon!
