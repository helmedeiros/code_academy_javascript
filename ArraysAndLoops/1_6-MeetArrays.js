// You are now declaring an array.
// Arrays are an awesome data structure!
/*Meet arrays
Variables can store numbers or strings. But so far, we've only been able to store ONE number or ONE string. Good thing we have arrays. Arrays:

a. store lists of data
b. can store different data types at the same time
c. are ordered so the position of each piece of data is fixed

Example:

var names = ["Mao","Gandhi","Mandela"];

var sizes = [4, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9];

var mixed = [34, "candy", "blue", 11];
Syntax:
var arrayName = [data, data, data];

Any time you see data surrounded by [ ], it is an array.
