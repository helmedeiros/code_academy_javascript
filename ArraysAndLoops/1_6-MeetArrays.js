// You are now declaring an array.
// Arrays are an awesome data structure!
/*Meet arrays
Variables can store numbers or strings. But so far, we've only been able to store ONE number or ONE string. Good thing we have arrays. Arrays:

a. store lists of data
b. can store different data types at the same time
c. are ordered so the position of each piece of data is fixed

Example:

var names = ["Mao","Gandhi","Mandela"];

var sizes = [4, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9];

var mixed = [34, "candy", "blue", 11];
Syntax:
var arrayName = [data, data, data];

Any time you see data surrounded by [ ], it is an array.

INSTRUCTIONS
Make your own array called junk. Put 4 bits of data in it (first 2 strings, then 2 numbers). 
1. Declare it using var.
3. Put your data around [ ] and separate each bit of data with a comma.
4. End it with a semi-colon.
5. Use console.log to print out junk.

var junk = ["a", "b", 1, 2];
console.log(junk);
