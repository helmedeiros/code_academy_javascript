// Practice array!
/*Array positions
It's nice that we can put a list of data into an array. But now we need to learn how to get access to the data inside the array.

The position of things in arrays is fixed. So we just need to know the array name (here, it is junkData), and the position of the data we want, and we're done.

Small complication: the position (or the index) of each bit of data is counted starting from 0, not 1.

First element in the array: junkData[0]
Third element in the array: junkData[2]
Arrays have 0-based indexing, so we start counting the positions from 0.

INSTRUCTIONS
Print out the fourth element of the array. 
1. Start with figuring out how to express what the fourth element in the array is.
2. Then use console.log() to print things out!

var junkData = ["Eddie Murphy", 49, "peanuts", 31];
console.log	(junkData[3]);
